  <br><br><img height=50 align=left src="images/g/time/night-sky.svg" alt="Night"> You are standing outside of Hall of Reconstruction. This is a short, squat, vicious-looking building, decorated with designs that indicate it is a house of reconstruction.   The sky overhead is pitch black. The only light here seems to emanate in a flickering manner from hellish firepits dotting the area. The broken remains of the door hang awkwardly from its hinges.<br><br>Located here are  a <span title="It is an irregular shape, but large."><u><font color=blue>Large Block of Ice</font></u></span>,  a <span title="It is an irregular shape, but large."><u><font color=blue>Large Block of Ice</font></u></span>.<br><br>Someone has written <i>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,  “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore; </i> in chalk on a wall here.<br><br>There are 0 other people here.</div>
